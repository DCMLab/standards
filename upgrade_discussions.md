# Things to discuss

All concrete examples that are discussed and where a decision is made should be added to a `FAQ` collection where the different options and decisions are listed for reference.

## [Segmentations (organ points, phrases etc.)](https://github.com/DCMLab/standards/labels/segmentations)

### [Forbidden repetitions of identical labels and exceptions](https://github.com/DCMLab/standards/issues/3)

* Let `\\` stand alone (without repeating identical harmony)
* (instead) generally allow for repeating identical harmonies as a means of creating "Sinneinheiten" ("meaningful" chord segments)

## [Changes](https://github.com/DCMLab/standards/labels/%27changes%27%20feature)

### [Suspensions & Retardations: Which note is being withheld?](https://github.com/DCMLab/standards/issues/4)

* New symbol for indicating that `2`, `4`, and `6` exceptionally replace the upper, not the lower neighbour?
* What about a `7` which exceptionally replaces the lower, not the upper neighbour?
* Additionally to added tones (e.g. `+9`), allow for missing tones (e.g. `-5`)

### [Level of detail concerning suspensions](https://github.com/DCMLab/standards/issues/5)

* Discuss concrete examples and add them to the FAQ
