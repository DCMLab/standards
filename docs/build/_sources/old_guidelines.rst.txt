Introduction
============

Thank you for your help in building an annotated music corpus. Harmonic
analysis is a notoriously complex task, as of now very difficult to
teach to a computer. Therefore, we need to rely on a handannotated
databasis when analyzing the development of tonal harmony over the last
five centuries with the quantitative methods. With this goal in mind, we
have devised an annotation standard for writing harmonic analyses in a
machine-readable format. This document will help you learn how to use
this standard.

The annotation process consists in adding Roman numerals to a digital
music score. In this context, we will call them 'symbols', 'chord
symbols', 'expressions' or 'annotations'. The chord analyses are added
via the chord symbol function in the open source notation software
`MuseScore
2.3.2 <https://musescore.org/en/download#Older-and-unsupported-versions>`__.

.. note::

   Note that Musescore 3 is available but that we are still working with
   the old version. The link brings you to "Older and unsupported
   versions", please download MuseScore 2.3.2 for your operation system
   there. You can have MuseScore 2 and 3 installed next to each other but
   this requires extra attention because MS3 cannot save files in MS2
   format. At some point in 2019 we will stop using MS2.

Depending on the
source of the notation file that you receive for annotation, it might be
advisable to have a scan of the *Urtext* opened in the background for
tacit correction of the score. At least the bar numbers have to be 100%
correct. Please make sure, that upbeat measures are counted by MuseScore
as measure 0.

For the computer assisted evaluation of your data, a number of things
are important:

-  Chord symbols (i.e. Roman numerals) have to be attached to the
   moments in the score where the respective harmony begins. They are
   understood to be valid until the next symbol is written. That is to
   say, identical symbols are never repeated consecutively.
-  The symbols have to be linked to the upper system of the score, even
   if it contains only rests. Every symbol has to be attached to the
   precise position where the harmony occurs. N.B.: Symbols are stored
   with the original position, even if you move them by hand!
-  If a symbol starts with a note name, Musescore will save it
   differently which annotators have to avoid by putting a dot in front
   of the note name. For example: ``I6``, ``ii7``, ``V65`` etc. can be
   written without a starting dot but ``.bVI`` and ``.Ger6`` (German
   sixth chord) need one, as does the initial indication of the main key
   such as ``.Eb.I.`` (BTW, the one and only actual pitch name needed
   and allowed in every piece, see
   ```{Indication of key.}`` <#indication-of-key>`__).
-  Arabic numbers indicating `inversions <#roman-numerals>`__ or
   `suspensions <#suspensions-and-retardations>`__ always appear in
   descending order (e.g. ``65`` or ``9#74``).
-  The information about a harmony has to be expressed in a fixed order
   (syntax). This `syntax <#the-syntax>`__ can be proofread by using the
   script HarmonyAnnotationChecker.jl
-  Major keys are indicated by uppercase, minor keys by lowercase
   letters.

However, as we are slowly moving towards automated analyses,
**consistency** is the order of the day. In other words, while different
annotators would interpret the same music differently, it is important
that the same annotator interprets the same music identically. That is
to say, once you have made a difficult decision about annotating a
certain chord progression, you have to stick to this decision every time
the progression occurs. If at one point, for the sake of consistency,
you get the idea of `copying your
annotations <#copying-several-annotations>`__ when music repeats, make
sure that you are dealing with an exact repetition and check the
annotations after copying.

Using MuseScore
===============

    If you are not familiar with the software, know that ``F12`` opens
    the navigator which facilitates navigating. If you prefer scrolling
    through pages vertically instead of horizontally, change
    ``Edit -> Preferences... -> Canvas -> Scroll pages``

There are two types of MuseScore files. The software saves files
automatically in the compressed format ``.mscz``, creating smaller file
sizes. However, we work with the uncompressed ``.mscx`` format because
it represents text files. The HarmonyAnnotationChecker script, for
example, works only on mscx, so make sure to save the annotated score in
this format by using ``Files -> Save As...`` and selecting the
"Uncompressed MuseScore File (\*.mscx)" format.

How to annotate
---------------

To type the chord symbols into the score comfortably, click once on one
note of the first harmony in the **upper staff** and press ``Ctrl + K``
which will activate a cursor above the system. After typing in the chord
expression, press ``Space`` to go to the next note or the next beat.
``Shift + Space`` will bring you back to the prior event, and ``Tab`` to
beat 1 of the next measure. And, importantly, ``Esc`` ends the chord
editing mode.

    All labels have to be attached to the upmost (i.e. right hand)
    staff. Within this staff, it does not matter to which voice they are
    attached.

Editing annotations
-------------------

If you want to change a chord symbol, double click (or tap) on it to get
into chord edit mode. To delete one, get out of edit mode, click on the
symbol once to select it, and press ``Delete``.

If you want to change the beat/position of a symbol, it is important not
to drag it horizontally because it stays linked to the moment where you
entered it. Therefore, you need to delete it and enter it anew on the
right position. Of course, the quickest way to do this is to double
click on the symbol, select the entire expression with ``Ctrl + A``,
cutting it with ``Ctrl + X``, moving to the correct position with
``Space`` or ``Shift + Space`` and insert it with ``Ctrl + V``.

Splitting beats
---------------

.. **Fortunately, this section has become obsolete when we learnt how to
   move the cursor by any note value**

It is as simple as pressing Ctrl+3 for moving the cursor by a 16th,
Ctrl+4 for an 8th and so on (same values as for note entry).

.. [STRIKEOUT:There are situations where several harmonies occur while in
   the voice in the upper system there is a rest or a longer note. If
   underneath a secondary voice occurs **!in the right hand staff!**, you
   may attach events to this one. Otherwise, you can select the long note
   or rest and skip to the correct beat using ``Space``. However, if in
   such a case you need to insert a symbol on a subbeat, you will have to
   split this rest or note, insert the symbol, and restore the original
   note value as explained here:]

Copying several annotations
---------------------------

If you find an exact repetition, make sure, it actually is an exact
repetition first before copying symbols. Then, go to the symbols you
want to copy. > If they expand over more than one system, you will have
to change "Page view" to "Continuous View". Generally, you will end up
in a different measure than expected and you can easily navigate to your
measure using ``Ctrl + F`` and typing the measure number.

To select the chord symbols (or anything else for that matter), press
``Shift`` to draw a frame around the symbols with your mouse (or touch
device). Copy with ``Ctrl + C``, then select the first beat where you
want to paste the symbols and press ``Ctrl + V``. It is important that
no other symbols exist in the range where you paste to avoid duplicates
or twofold annotations for the same position.

Visibility
----------

Although not important for the computerised analysis of your
annotations, it is preferrable to arrange them in a human-readable way.
\* If two expressions overlap horizontally, just drag the first one up
or down with your mouse (or touch device). Make sure to leave any edit
mode first, using ``Esc``. \* If expressions overlap with notes, you can
drag them manually as well. But if this is often the case, you might
want to \* change the distance between the chord symbols and the
respective system for the entire document by changing the value of
``Style -> General... -> Chord Symbols, Fretboard Diagrams -> Default vertical position``.
A usable value might lie around ``6.00sp``. If the distance is good but
chord symbols overlap with the above system, you might want to \* change
the distance between all systems by raising the value of
``Style -> General... -> Page -> Min. system distance``. Note that you
might have to adjust ``Max. system distance`` if you need high values.

The syntax
==========

Every symbol *must* have at least one compulsory Roman numeral and *may*
start with an indication of key, followed by a separating dot. Such an
indication sets the context for the (compulsorily) attached Roman
numeral *and* for all subsequent symbols up to the next indication of
key.

Indication of key.
------------------

-  The first symbol written in a score always starts with the absolute
   indication of the entire piece's tonality.
-  Simply type the tonic's note name {A/a,B/b,C/c,D/d,E/e,F/f,G/g(#/b)}
   within two dots. Remember that symbols starting with a note name have
   to be preceded by a dot. Examples: ``.f#.i`` for the first harmony of
   a piece in F sharp minor; ``.Ab.I`` for the first harmony of a piece
   in A flat major; both pieces beginning with the tonic harmony.
-  All other indications of key (i.e. 'local keys') are entered as Roman
   numerals relative to that.
-  Example 1: As soon as a piece in C major modulates to G major, you
   can indicate the new key by typing ``V.I`` over the harmony of G
   major. All subsequent Roman numerals up to the next indication of key
   relate to the new key of G major. Note that altered scale degrees
   beginning with ``b`` such as ``.bVII.`` have to start with a leading
   dot because ``b`` is a note name.
-  There is a way of annotating secondary dominants (see `relative
   key <#relative-key>`__); however, if you find a ``V/vi`` chord and
   the music then stays in the key of ``vi`` for a longer time (cf. next
   paragraph), you can write ``vi.V`` right away. Every following ``i``
   symbol designates the new tonic.

**Important** ``I6 ii65/V V7/V V`` and ``I6 V.ii65 V7 I`` (see example
below), in general, have the same meaning but a preference has to be
given either to the first version - i.e., with **applied chords** - or
to the second -i.e., with change of **local key**. In principle, it is
an objective of your analyses to include a bigger picture of a piece's
tonality through exactly this kind of choices. This means that upon
making such a choice, you need to include the broader context: \* If the
example passage is a mere tonicization of ``V`` followed by a return to
the original tonic, that is a case for the version with applied chords
because the local key stays the same. \* In the special case, that this
would be a cadence to ``V``, followed by a return to the original tonic,
you should even opt for ``I6 ii65/V V7/V I/V`` (**NB** ``I/V`` has the
same meaning as ``V``) because an Authentic Cadence should always end
with some sort of tonic symbol. \* If, on the other hand, the music
continues in the key of V, the second option should be chosen. The
general rule is that, in such a modulation, the change of local key
should be annotated as early as consistently possible; so you could even
write ``V.IV6 ii65 V7 I``.

    Note that the key indications of applied chords always relate to the
    local key (see the following section). So, if the Schumann example
    below was not in E major but in A major instead, the same harmonic
    progression would be standing in the key of V:
    [V.]``I6 ii65/V V7/V I(4)/V`` with the **applied notation**
    remaining unchanged (``/V``) because it is **relative** to the local
    key; whereas the **change of local key** would indicate the
    *absolute* key instead: [V.]``I6 II.ii65 V7 I(4)``

| |ocal\_key\_correct|   | |local\_key\_wrong|   |
+------------------------+-----------------------+

The rationale behind this logic can be seen in these automated key
analyses of two different annotations of the same piece:

+--------------------------------------+--------------------+

+--------------------------------------+--------------------+

*Gantt chart showing the local keys in the first movement of Mozart's
piano sonata F major, K. 533*

Relative key
------------

If a symbol relates to a different key than the one you are in, you can
indicate the relative key using a slash ``/``. Most prominently this is
the case for secondary dominants such as ``V65/IV``. The relative key is
indicated as relative to the local key and does not change the local
key. E.g.: ``iv.i #viio6 i6 V65/iv iv viio7/V V7 i`` (see below)
designates a cadence in the key of ``iv`` (here: G minor) because of the
initial indication of key. Note that \* the relative keys ``iv`` (C
minor) and ``V`` (D major) relate to the *local* key ``iv`` and not to
the *global* (tonic) key (here: D minor); \* ``viio7/V`` is not spelled
``#viio7/V`` although the bass is altered. The reason is that it is the
natural 7th scale degree in the key of ``V`` (D **major**). B flat, of
course, is not natural in D major but is clearly annotated through the
choice of ``viio7`` rather than ``vii%7``. \* combining relative key
with a modulation can be counterintuitive because relative keys relate
to the *local* key, whereas `key indications <#--indication-of-key-->`__
used for modulation always relate to the *global* key. A theoretically
correct but illegible and non-sensical variant of the example annotation
would be ``iv.i #viio6 i6 V65/iv vii.i #viio7/ii V7/v iv.i`` To avoid
confusion, don't use relative key annotation if a modulation to that
same relative key follows.

.. figure:: ../img/relativekey.png
   :alt: relativekey

Relative keys of relative keys can be annotated, for example the
dominant of the dominant of the dominant: ``V7/V/V``.

Roman numerals
--------------

The smallest possible symbols consist of a single Roman numeral. They
stand for a major (``I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII``) or minor
(``i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii``) triad in root position. *All other
chords* - those which are no major or minor root position triad on one
of the key's natural degrees - need additional symbols. For altered
scale degrees simply use ``[.]b/#``\ +[Roman numeral], e.g. ``.bVI`` for
an Ab major chord in the context of C major; or ``#vi`` for an A minor
chord in the context of C minor. Remember the leading dots if ``b``
appears at the beginning of a symbol (``V/bVI`` works but ``bVI`` not!).

    You always indicate the chord type *before* the inversion.

Triads
~~~~~~

Every triad symbol must indicate the [type of triad] and its {inversion}
if it is one.

-  Other than major triads (``I``) and minor triads (``i``) the syntax
   provides the symbol ``o`` for diminished triads (e.g. ``viio`` in the
   major or ``#viio`` in the minor) and the symbol ``+`` for augmented
   triads (e.g. ``I+``). Summary:
-  major: uppercase numeral
-  minor: lowercase numeral
-  diminished: lowercase numeral + ``o``
-  augmented: uppercase numeral + ``+``
-  Inversions are annotated by adding ``6`` or ``64`` (NOT ``46``) to
   the triad type. Examples:
-  ``ii6`` in major context, ``iio6`` in minor context
-  ``viio6`` in major context, ``#viio6`` in minor context
-  ``I64`` for a passing 64 chord on scale degree ^5 (as opposed to a
   dominant with 64-suspension, `see
   below <#suspensions-and-retardations>`__)
-  ``I+6`` as a shorthand for V6/IV with augmented fifth (relative to
   the root, `see below <#suspensions-and-retardations>`__).

Tetrads
~~~~~~~

All tetrads are annotated as springing from a seventh chord. Therefore,
every tetrad must indicate the [type of seventh chord] AND, for example,
a ``7`` for root position OR ``65 43 2`` for the three possible
inversions.

-  The possible types of root position seventh chords are:
-  diminished seventh: lowercase numeral + ``o7``, Examples:
   ``#viio7 iio65``
-  half-diminished seventh: lowercase numeral + ``%7``, e.g.
   ``viio%7 ii%43``
-  mm7 (minor seventh): lowercase numeral + ``7``, e.g. ``ii7 i2``
-  mM7 (minor with major seventh): lowercase numeral + ``M7``, e.g.
   ``ivM7`` (although, in most cases, such a chord will be annotated as
   a retardation of 8, see below)
-  MM7 (major seventh): uppercase numeral + ``M7``, e.g. ``IVM7 IIIM65``
-  Mm7 (dominant seventh): ``V7``. Theoretically, it could appear on
   other degrees than V, e.g. in a falling fifths progression:
   ``i iv7``\ **``VII7``**\ ``IIIM7 VIM7 ii%7 V7 i`` - but in such a
   case, where the respective tonic follows, it will be annotated as
   (secondary) dominant:
   ``i iv7``\ **``V7/III``**\ ``IIIM7 VIM7 ii%7 V7 i``. However, there
   are cases where the same sonority occurs as ``IV7`` or ``IV65`` in a
   minor key, which will not be notated as a dominant.
-  The respective inversions are annotated by replacing ``7`` with
   ``65`` (NOT ``56``), ``43`` (NOT ``34``) or ``2`` respectively.
-  There are special symbols to annotate the French, German and Italian
   sixth chords: ``.Fr6``, ``.Ger6`` and ``.It6``. The latter actually
   does not need an initial dot because it does not start with a note
   name.

Suspensions and retardations
----------------------------

Suspensions and retardations are annotated as arabic numbers within
round parantheses ``()`` following the Roman numeral. The numbers
designate the note's interval **to the root**. That is to say a
suspensional 4 is marked as ``(4)`` in any inversion:
``V(4) V6(4) V65(4) V43(4) V2(4)`` (yes, two of them have the suspension
in the bass). It implies, that the functional third of the chord (i.e.,
the third above the root) is not present. In order to indicate the
resolution, write the sounding chord without the suspension, e.g.
``V65(4) V65`` or ``V(4) V7``. If an interval is altered, add ``#/b`` in
front of the digit, e.g. ``V7(b6) V7``, which is possible only in a
major context because in minor, the 6th would already be flat. If
several suspensions are sounding at the same time, annotate all of them
within the same parenthesis and always in descending order, e.g.
``V(64)``. A *cadenza doppia* could look like ``V7 V(64) V(4) V``
followed by ``I`` or ``i``.

The digits stand for \* ``(2)``: Suspension over the root, meaning that
the **root is not present** in the chord; as opposed to \* ``(9)``:
designating the same pitch but indicating that the **root is present**
at the same time; \* ``(4)``: Suspension over the third \* ``(6)``:
Suspension over the fifth \* ``(7)``: Retardation of the root, i.e. the
resolution goes upwards \* ``(#``\ *``N``*\ ``)``: digit *N* is a
retardation resolving upwards, e.g. ``(#2)`` retarding the third. The
``#`` overrides the rule that you use ``(2)`` only if the root is not
present. \* ``(b``\ *``N``*\ ``)``: digit *N* is a suspension resolving
downwards > Attention! Designating suspensions or retardations as
intervalls above the root will be counterintuitive if you are used to
thinking in figured bass. For example, a falling fauxbourdon
``ii6 I6 viio6`` with 7-6 suspensions has to be written as
``ii6(2) ii6 I6(2) I6 viio6(2) viio6``. Note that you use ``(2)`` and
not ``(9)`` because the root is not present. > Other than what some
would typically write, a Classical retardated ending looks like
``i(9#74) i``, and not ``i(#742) i`` or ``i(24#7) i``.

Added notes
-----------

Generally, there are only very few notes in the Common practice era
which cannot be explained as suspensions or retardations. > One should
add that we don't annotate neighbour notes, passing notes nor
embellishments.

A typical additional note would be that of a pedal note which appears in
a different voice than the bass. In this case, you would annotate the
additional note - analogue to a suspension - as a digit indicating the
interval *from the root* in parenthesis, but preceded by a ``+``.
Example: Imagine a C major context and a pedal on G in some middle
voice. Around that, the other voices do the progression
``I viio6 I6 ii6 I64 IV6 .Ger6 V\\``: Some harmonies contain the G and
do not change (namely ``I``, ``I6``, ``I64`` and ``V``), one harmony
supports an added G (``viio6`` with G is ``V43``) and the rest neither
support G nor can it be interpreted as suspensions. So the correct
annotation would be ``I V43 I6 ii6(+4) I64 IV6(+2) .Ger6(+7) V\\``.

Sometimes, it can seem ambiguous whether a note is an added note, a
suspension without resolution or an embellishment (anticipation). The
following example from Monteverdi's *Lamento della ninfa* might give a
hint how to differentiate.

.. figure:: ../img/added_notes.png
   :alt: added\_notes

Compare the first halves of mm. 40, 41 and 44. The B in m. 41 is
interpreted as an embellishment (incomplete neighbour) although it could
be seen as part of a ``iio43``. The B in m. 40, however, is interpreted
as being more than just an embellishment (anticipation) because it is
more pronounced. However, unlike in m. 44, the B is neither prepared nor
resolved and therefore it is annotated as added note, i.e. ``i(+9)``,
rather than as a suspension ``i(9)``.

Phrase endings
--------------

The structural ending of a phrase - typically the target chord of a
cadence - should be marked with a double backslash ``\\``. **Important:
The ``\\`` always has to be the last element of the expression.** > Be
careful: relative keys are indicated with a single slash ``/`` and
phrase endings with double backslash ``\\``

    It has proven useful to listen to your completely annotated score
    once again just to detect phrase endings and cadences.

Note that many cadences are followed by an appendix. The phrase-end
symbol does not have to be repeated at the end of the appendix. Unlike
the harmony part of symbol (which is operative until the next symbol),
the double backslash marks the time point at which it appears (which is
different to the closing brackets of a pedal point).

    For this reason, in rare cases, a label has to be repeated if the
    respective harmony appears already before the actual phrase ending,
    e.g. Chopin's Mazurka BI77-3op17-3.mscx mm. 47f.

A half cadence, for example, could look like ``ii6 V65/V V\\``. The
appendix does not receive another phrase-ending symbol (see Example from
KV 576, I, 26-8).

Pedal points (Organ points)
---------------------------

If several harmonies appear over the same bass note, the start of the
pedal point is marked by ``[`` and the end by ``]``. In front of the
opening ``[`` stands the Roman numeral corresponding to the bass note's
scale degree, immediately followed (within the same expression!) by the
first harmony above the bass note. Thus, the most common pedal points
start with ``I[I``, ``i[V7/iv`` or ``V[V``. The pedal point ends at the
end of the terminal symbol's duration, i.e. it ends with the next symbol
after ``I]`` or ``V7]``.

The two criteria must apply for using the pedal-point annotation: \* if
it involves three or more distinct harmonic events sharing the same bass
note \* at least one harmony appears of which the pedal note is not a
component.

Therefore, a 5/3-6/4-5/3 contrapuntal movement (often on scale degree 1)
is generally annotated as a simple neighboring motion over a pedal
point: ``I I(64) I`` (in other words, the information that we are
confronting a pedal-point motion is implied in this expression).

If you think about it, if you want to write the simple progression
``I I(64) I`` as an organ point, you're left with four different
possibilities, depending on whether or not you include the bass note in
the harmonies above it: \* ``I[I IV I]`` or \* ``I[I IV64 I]`` or \*
``I[I6 IV I6]`` or \* ``I[I I(64) I]``

This question occurs for nearly every organ point you will come to
write. A rule of thumb is: If the bass note is a part of the harmony,
you write the inversion corresponding to the bass note; otherwise, the
inversion of the chord above. But, more importantly, another rule can
override this: The harmonic progression above the organ point should be
meaningful in itself. For example, if there is a fauxbourdon, you might
not want to include the bass note but highlight the sixth chords:
``I[IV6 iii6 ii6 I6 viio6 I]`` rather than
``I[IV64 iii6 ii6 I viio6 I]``

    If you change the local key, you need to end the pedal point with
    the previous label and start a new one. (e.g.
    ``WWV096-Meistersinger_01_Vorspiel-Prelude_SchottKleinmichel.mscx``,
    mm. 33f.)

Ambiguity
---------

If two interpretations are possible and you are unable to make a
decision, you can give both interpretations by separating them with a
dash ``-``, e.g. ``viio6-V43``. Use this means as a last resort only and
make sure that both interpretations are valid readings *within their
context*, i.e. if you read each interpretation in line with the prior
and the following symbol. This implies that no modulation can occur
within an ambiguous expression (such as ``viio7/V-v.#viio7``) because
only one of the readings can be correct in context with the following
expression. It is possible to give a relative key (e.g. ``I6-V6/IV``)
because both options create correct readings.

Unisono
-------

Single voice passages generally imply harmonies which you are asked to
infer. If the information of the melody line is too sparse to be sure
whether it is implying ``viio6`` or ``V43``, for example, you will most
likely opt for an ambiguous annotation. However, in such a case, you are
also free to choose one interpretation because it is more stereotypical
than the other or because it alludes to another passage of the same
piece. If no harmony can be inferred - in particular where a composer
deliberately withdraws tonal footing - use the symbol ``@none``.

Summary
=======

One of the longest possible expressions would be
``.bvii.V[#viio65(+b84)/#vi``. This, of course, is quite theoretical and
simply a demonstration of order and meaning of the different syntactic
components, with concrete examples given in relation to C major: \*
``.bvii.``, in the context of a major key *(C major)*, means that all
following symbols relate to the minor key on the lowered 7th scale
degree *(Bb minor)*. The initial dot is necessary because ``b`` is a
note name. \* ``V[`` designates the beginning of an organ point on the
5th scale degree *(F)*. \* ``#viio65`` stands for the first inversion of
a diminished seventh chord of the raised 7th scale degree \* ``(+b84)``
designates an added diminished octave (added notes usually occur because
of pedal tones that are not in the bass) and a (not added but) suspended
fourth, withholding the third \* ``/#vi`` means that this chord (the
``#viio65``) relates to the raised 6th scale degree. *Which, in Bb
minor, would be G. Therefore, the root of ``#viio65/#vi`` would be F#.*

Here, you can see an imaginary context, in C major, where this example
could theoretically occur: |longexpression|
