Summary
=======

One of the longest possible expressions would be
``.bvii.V[#viio65(+b84)/#vi``. This, of course, is quite theoretical and
simply a demonstration of order and meaning of the different syntactic
components, with concrete examples given in relation to C major: \*
``.bvii.``, in the context of a major key *(C major)*, means that all
following symbols relate to the minor key on the lowered 7th scale
degree *(Bb minor)*. The initial dot is necessary because ``b`` is a
note name. \* ``V[`` designates the beginning of an organ point on the
5th scale degree *(F)*. \* ``#viio65`` stands for the first inversion of
a diminished seventh chord of the raised 7th scale degree \* ``(+b84)``
designates an added diminished octave (added notes usually occur because
of pedal tones that are not in the bass) and a (not added but) suspended
fourth, withholding the third \* ``/#vi`` means that this chord (the
``#viio65``) relates to the raised 6th scale degree. *Which, in Bb
minor, would be G. Therefore, the root of ``#viio65/#vi`` would be F#.*

Here, you can see an imaginary context, in C major, where this example
could theoretically occur: |longexpression|
