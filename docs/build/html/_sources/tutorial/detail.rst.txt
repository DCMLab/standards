In this section we discuss the single **most pertinent cause for inter-annotator disagreement**: The question of how large
of a musical chunk we want to compress into a label. There is definitely not one correct answer, instead we ask our
annotators to make one high-level decision for a given piece and stick to that consistently. That's what was meant in the
previous section by the assignment

.. admonition:: Do a complete annotation of ``corelli_op01n04b.mscx`` after deciding on its harmonic pace
  :class: toggle

  What harmonic pace did you decide on and how did you decide? Did you listen to a recording or to a live rendition in
  your head? In case you didn't, does `listening to a recording <https://youtu.be/OKp_abVXIq8?t=54>`__ make you want to
  change your mind? In the latter case, please create an alternative set of annotations in a separate file for
  comparison.

  Once you're settled, let's walk through some of the possibilities and
  their implications.

Solution 1: Coarse-grained
==========================

  Coarse-grained analysis of Corelli op. 1/4, II. Adagio

This solution focuses on chunks of a half note's length. There are a couple of things to note:

.. |funny_dash| image:: img/funny_dash.png
  :scale: 30 %

:Harmonic pace:
  The annotator settled on half measures. The set of annotations demonstrates the consequences of this decision:
  Many eighth notes are interpreted as ornaments and thus not reflected in the labels. When using the DCML standard
  we do annotate non-chord tones such as suspensions, retardations, additions (see REFERENCE), but not ornaments.

:Indeterminacy:
  In m. 2, the new harmony is mainly determined by the pitches F and A. Even if an annotator has a strong opinion,
  it is a good idea to express the indeterminacy by writing both possibilities in one label, separated by a dash,
  ``VI-iv6``. A label can include only one alternative (i.e., one dash), and the annotator puts the solution they prefer
  in the front. In the present case, don't worry about the funny dash placement |funny_dash| when writing
  ``iv6-VI``.

:Phrasing:
  One's interpretation of the harmonic pace might correlate with one's perception of musical phrases. The analysis here
  expresses fluidity not only through a harmonic rhythm in 2/2 meter but also by having the first phrase end only
  in m. 8 after the harmonic "double time" and the pronounced cadence.

Solution 2: Fine-grained
========================

.. figure:: img/detail_02_corelli_fine.svg
  :alt: Fine-grained analysis of Corelli op. 1/4, II. Adagio
  :scale: 30%

  Fine-grained analysis of Corelli op. 1/4, II. Adagio. Differences to above highlighted in bold.

Let's have a look at the differences.

:Harmonic pace:
  This set of annotations is susceptible to the change of harmony on the quarter beat level. Whereas in the above version
  four step-wise descending eighth notes were mostly considered as elaborations of ond and the same chord, this one here
  reveals a tendency to see them as elaborations of chord tones from two *different* chords. In particular, the
  annotator has highlighted implicit 5-6 movements through the pertinent patterns ``i VI6`` (mm. 4 & 9), ``iv iio6``
  (m. 3), and ``VI iv6`` (m. 2, that one purely virtual). Where the descending eights motive occurs in the bass, two
  chords with their bass notes a third apart have been assumed (mm. 2, 6 & 9); and where this was not plausible
  (mm. 5 & 8), a change of harmony was assumed on the fourth note. This solution seems to suggest syncopated harmonic
  rhythms in mm. 2-3 & 9.

:Indeterminacy:
  While being more bold in assuming particular chord tones in m. 2, this solution introduces alternative labels for the
  dominant chords in mm. 3 & 6; namely labels interpreting the same chord as elaborations of dominant seventh chords.
  For reasons of consistency, the same interpretation would have applied to m. 8: ``V}{-V2}{`` (every side of the dash
  needs to be a fully valid reading, which is why the phrase annotations should be repeated). But two reasons speak
  against this interpretation: (1) it would conflict with the ``V64`` label on the last eighth which, however, reflects
  consistency with the above-mentioned analytical decision and m. 5; and (2) the alternative reading ``V2`` would
  represent a possible harmonic progression ``iv6 V2}{`` which is implausible in this cadential context.

:Phrasing:
  The more fine-grained harmonic analysis has led the annotator to assume shorter phrases, too: The long first phrase
  from Solution 1 (mm. 1-8) has been split into two interlocked phrases here.

.. admonition:: Hint
  :class: caution

  On the more abstract level seen in Solution 1 the predominant root progression is by falling fifth (``i iv`` and
  ``ii V i``). Theorists know that a scaffold of falling fifths affords movement by falling thirds and it is therefore
  not surprising that a more fine-grained solution exists which highlights these (``i VI iv ii [#viio] V [III] i``).

.. admonition:: Consistency is watching you
  :class: danger

  Note how in both examples the analytical decisions were implemented with rigorous consistency which is the DCML
  annotation standard's highest maxim.


Solution 3: A bit over the top
==============================

.. figure:: img/detail_03_corelli_very.svg
  :alt: Too fine-grained analysis of Corelli op. 1/4, II. Adagio
  :scale: 30%

  Too fine-grained and partially inconsistent analysis of Corelli op. 1/4, II. Adagio.

The fictional annotator behind this analysis had just learned about the chord alteration syntax using rounded
brackets ``()`` and wanted to use it everywhere! Let's say we leave them the pleasure for now to not steal their
thunder, but consistency is nevertheless indispensable. Before you try to spot some of the inconsistencies, it will be
useful for you to understand to how the chord alterations work, so you can empathize with this greenhorn.

* If an upper neighbour of one of the three chord tones ``1``, ``3``, ``5`` is present within the parentheses,
  e.g. ``V(2)``, ``V(4)``, ``V(6)``, it means that the respective chord tone is replaced (the fourth suspension
  we had seen already).
* This is independent of the chord inversion, so ``iv6(2)`` means that the chord root is replaced by its upper
  neighbour (see the 7-6 suspension in all three solutions, m. 8).
* If the actual chord tone is not replaced, but the upper neighbour is instead added, it is preceded by a ``+``,
  as is the case in ``V6(+6)`` in m. 6.
* The upper neighbours can occur simultaneously (always in descending order) and always represent the interval
  corresponding to the scale. In other words,

  - ``iv(4)`` translates to the pitches ``F B C`` in a C major context but in a C minor context it means ``F Bb C``;
  - to express ``F Bb C`` in a C major context we would have to write ``iv(b4)`` or ``IV(b4)`` accordingly;
  - ``bII6`` translates to ``F Ab Db`` in both C major and minor, but ``bII6(62)`` is ``F B E`` in C major yet
    ``F Bb Eb`` in C minor;
  - on the other hand, the same suspension chord ``F Bb Eb`` in a C major context would need to be expressed as
    ``bII(b6b2)``.

Can you feel the joy that drove our fictitious annotator to use rounded brackets that frequently here? So let's show
them some indulgence - but only where the analytical decisions are traceable and applied consistently.

.. admonition:: Spot as many places as possible where the annotations are inconsistent or a bit over the top.
  :class: toggle

  * m. 2: ``iv6 VI`` not justified
  * m. 4 & 10: ``iio6-ii%65`` vs. ``iio6 ii%65-iio6`` (alternative reading would result in redundant progression
    ``iio6 iio6``)
  * m. 4 & 7: phrase boundaries?
  * m. 4 & 9: ``VI6`` vs. ``i(6) i``
  * m. 5 & 8: ``V64`` vs. ``V43``
  * m. 6: ``V65`` inkonsistent
  * m. 7: ``V(6)/iv V/iv``
  * m. 9: ``#viio6`` possible but plausible?
  * m. 11: ``iv7`` D root, not transition?
