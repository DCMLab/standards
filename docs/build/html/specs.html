<p>These specs fulfill at least two purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Keeping track of what the DCML harmony labels express</p></li>
<li><p>Being a resource for researchers and developers who want to interact with them</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This way, the annotation standard’s current limitations become transparent
and everyone who wants to help improving them can be on the same page. The
current state of the corresponding discussions can be seen in this repo’s
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/DCMLab/standards/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<h2>What is being encoded?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-being-encoded" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section elicits the general principles and assumptions underlying the
DCML harmony annotation standard.</p>
<div class="section" id="segmentations">
<h3>Segmentations<a class="headerlink" href="#segmentations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>DCML harmony labels represent a score segmentation on various levels:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>key areas (tonalities)</p></li>
<li><p>harmonic segments</p></li>
<li><p>chord and non-chord tones are distinguished from ornaments</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The annotations follow the basic principle that a key or a harmony begins at the
timestamp that the designating label is attached to and stays effective up to
the subsequent change (half-open intervals). Following this principle</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the <strong>key</strong> is defined for every harmony as long as the first harmony label
comes with information about its key;</p></li>
<li><p>from the first harmony label onwards, the beginning of every event falls
into exactly one <strong>harmonic segment</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By <strong>key</strong> we understand an ordered set of unique tonal pitch classes (a
<strong>scale</strong>) of which
we call the first one <strong>root</strong> (<cite>tonic, home, one, I, 1, (relative) DO</cite>,
etc.). The annotation standard is an expression of the basic assumption that
the music to which it is being applied is hierarchically organised ‘around’
the root. This is expressed through numbering the key’s ordered pitch classes,
its scale degrees, using either Roman or Arabic numerals, depending on the
context. Tones which are not part of the key’s scale are expressed in relation
to its scale degrees via the accidentals {♯♮♭} which we facilitate to {#b}.</p>
<p>By <strong>harmonic segment</strong> we understand a continuous score segment encompassing
all staves. Therefore, it has the same morphology as a slice with the difference
that the word slice is generally associated with a harmonic segment which does
have a duration but no rhythm. In that sense, harmonic segment is the more
general concept which can include anything from a single slice to a whole piece.
The criterion for harmonic segmentation is a given set of features: The music
pertaining to harmonic segments that have been identically labelled has
the same harmonic features, provided that the identical set of features has
been used as segmentation criterion in all cases.</p>
<p>The following section explains how the segmentations’ timestamps are
encoded whereas the expression of chord and non-chord tones will be
specified in the <a class="reference internal" href="#regex"><span class="std std-ref">regEx</span></a> section below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="timestamps">
<h3>Timestamps<a class="headerlink" href="#timestamps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The way DCML harmony labels are entered in the <a class="reference external" href="https://musescore.org/en/download">MuseScore 3</a>
notation software ensures that each of them is attached to a timestamp in the
score. The software allows for attaching several labels to the same time point,
even in the same staff, and annotators are asked to avoid this. In the future,
this would make it possible to have a score include several annotation layers
simultaneously which would only need to have a clearly distinguishable syntax.</p>
<p>Additionally, the standard offers the possibility to annotate phrases. These
may not be hierarchically nested but most naturally they should coincide with
one given level of a hierarchical form analysis. The annotator’s guidelines are
quite vague in this regard and leave it open on which hierarchical level – if
at all – the annotator wants to use phrase annotations. This is the test whether the line</p>
